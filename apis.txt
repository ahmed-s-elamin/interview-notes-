API: an application programming interface is a set of pf rules, protocols
and tools that allow the communication between software applications.
think of it as a messanger that takes a request from a software application 
to another application.

REST API: (representationa state transfer) is an api that follows the principles of REST 
architectural style,it is a set of rules and protocols that define how web services should
communicate with each other over the internet.

A RESTful API: typically uses HTTP protocols to communicate, and relies of on a set of standard
HTTP methods such as GET POST PUT and DELETE to perform actions on resources which are identified
by unique URLs and the api returns data in the format of JSON or XML

key feature of a RESTful API is its statelessness. This means the server doesn't need to
store any information about the client's previous request. this makes them highly scalable
